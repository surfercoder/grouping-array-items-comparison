We are going to make a small comparison between one way of the old school to group array items against the new `Object.groupBy()`.

In the example we are taking a harcoded data (`inventory`) and we are going to group them by their `type` property.

You would see that `Object.groupBy()` not only is way less verbose (1 LOC vs 9 LOC) but it is also way more performant (0.007ms vs 0.019), so go ahead and start using it in your code!
